# File Organizer Script

A Python script to organize files in a directory by moving them into folders named after their file extensions. For example:
- `.jpg` files → `JPG_Files`
- `.txt` files → `TXT_Files`

The script skips directories, files without extensions, and itself. It’s simple, efficient, and works for any file type.
